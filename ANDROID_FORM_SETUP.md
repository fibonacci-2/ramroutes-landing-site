# Android Form Email Setup Guide

## Current Implementation
The Android form is now set up with automatic email functionality. Here are the different approaches implemented with fallbacks:

## Option 1: Current Setup (Works immediately)
- **Primary**: Sends data to JSONPlaceholder API (demo endpoint)
- **Fallback 1**: Saves requests to localStorage for admin viewing
- **Fallback 2**: Opens mailto link if all else fails

## Option 2: Webhook Setup (Recommended for production)

### Using Webhook.site (Free, 5 minutes setup):
1. Go to https://webhook.site
2. Copy your unique webhook URL
3. Replace `'https://webhook.site/your-unique-url'` in AndroidForm.js with your URL
4. All form submissions will appear on your webhook.site page in real-time

### Using Zapier (Free tier available):
1. Create a Zapier account
2. Create a new Zap with "Webhooks by Zapier" trigger
3. Set action to "Gmail - Send Email" 
4. Replace the webhook URL in the code with your Zapier webhook URL

## Option 3: Formspree (Simple email forms)
1. Go to https://formspree.io
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Replace the JSONPlaceholder URL with your Formspree endpoint
5. Formspree will automatically email you when someone submits the form

## Option 4: EmailJS (Client-side email)
1. Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Create account and set up email service
3. Get your service ID, template ID, and public key
4. Uncomment the EmailJS code in AndroidForm.js
5. Replace the placeholder values with your actual EmailJS credentials

## Admin Panel
- Click the "Admin: View Requests" button (bottom right) to see all stored requests
- Copy individual emails or all emails at once
- Delete requests or clear all requests
- Refresh to see new requests

## Current Features:
